### About Bike Park Wales
The concept is simple, picture a ski resort, remove the snow and replace the pistes with an array of sweeping flowy bike trails meandering to the bottom of the mountain and you are close.  Add a bunch of adrenalin and big sprinkle of fun and you are pretty much there. BikePark Wales is an exhilarating  way to spend your day in the Welsh mountains.  

For beginner mountain bikers through to seasoned downhill pro's, BikePark Wales will offer you an incredible experience unlike anything else in the UK.  We have the longest green and blue graded descents in the UK offering unbelievable fun and a perfect opportunity to progress for beginner and intermediate riders. With over 40 trails to choose from even the best riders will spend several blissfully adrenaline filled days exploring our hugely diverse trail network.

Our series of lift assisted trails for riders of all abilities offer the ultimate riding experience.  With a mix of incredible all weather roller coaster trails and some of the best natural Singletrack the UK has to offer, we challenge you to supress the silly grin on your face at the bottom of each run.

Uplift: Our fleet of mini buses will transport you quickly, safely and comfortably to 491m, the top of our mountain, Myndd Gethin. You will be dropped off at the very top of the hill right next to the start of our trails.  All that remains to do is select your route and whoop and holler your way back to the bottom of the mountain in time to catch the next lift up.

If you would rather not use our uplift and you feel up to the challenge we also have a Singletrack climb so you can pedal your way to the top of the hill before choosing your route down.


## WHY PAY TO RIDE?
BikePark Wales is a unique mountain biking venue, we were the first place in the UK to have a full time crew looking after our trails and ensuring they are kept in great condition for your riding pleasure. Our business model is to continually re-invest in the park and create new sections of trail for your enjoyment, you should find new additions or changes to ride on every visit.  Your entry fee will help us maintain and grow our trail network for years to come and we are committed to investing every penny (and more!) of the pedal pass fee directly back into trail maintenance and expansion.  Our aim is to always be one of the best mountain biking destinations in the World, a must visit spot for all mountain bikers.
